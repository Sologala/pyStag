# This is a simple python binding of [Stag Fiducial Marker System](https://github.com/bbenligiray/stag)

# Dependency

1. **numpy** `pip install numpy`
2. **cmake**
3. **Pybind11** `pip install pybind11`


# Usage

1. clone this repository
   ```shell
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Sologala/pyStag.git
   ```

2. Find out your `numpy include` Path 	

   ```python
   In [1]: import numpy
   In [2]: numpy.get_include()
   Out[2]: '/Users/bytedance/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/include'
   ```

3. Fill `numpy include` to `CmakeLists.txt`

   ```cmake
   include_directories(
       pybindSrc/opencv2numpy
       # You need to change this follow Path  to  your own Path. 
       # "# You need to change this follow Path  to  your own Path. "
       # "# You need to change this follow Path  to  your own Path. "
       # "# You need to change this follow Path  to  your own Path. "
       # "# You need to change this follow Path  to  your own Path. "
       
       /Users/bytedance/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/include
   )
   ```

   

4. make

   ```shell
   mkdir build 
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   

5. then you will got a `pyStag.cpython-3*-**.pyd`  in `./lib`

6. **install Python package**
- open cmd
- cd to pyStag directory

   ```
   python setup.py install 
   ```
You must import your opencv dll in your site-packages directory. ("users/Anaconda/Lib/site-packages" for Anaconda).
If **import error DLL load failed while importing pyStag**: check dependencies with [DependencyWalker](https://www.dependencywalker.com/).

#  Test

```
python test_warpper.py
```





# PS.

Now, this is  just a prototype for warpping Stag system. It has only few attributes and interfaces, and function, And I will add some more in the future.

thank to [edmBernard](https://github.com/edmBernard)'s work https://github.com/edmBernard/pybind11_opencv_numpy, let the conversion between numpy and cv::Mat works fine.
